# TAX TIDY

## :bulb: About 
This app is a tool to keep track of tax deductions each financial year.

It has the functionality of CRUD methods for deductions using a PostgreSQL database and AWS S3 storage for uploaded images.

Expenses can be viewed individually with the receipt, summarised in a table, bar chart and pie chart. 

## :books: Learning Outcome

This was devloped to practise concepts learnt. Initially it includes Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, AWS3, Bootstrap.
I hope to continue to build it as we progress with JavaScript and React.

## :clipboard: Installation

This app uses Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL and the following dependancies:
- gem 'bootstrap', '~> 4.5.2'
- gem 'jquery-rails'
- gem 'simple_form'
- gem 'devise'
- gem 'chartkick'

## :construction: Further development

This is a MVP but still work in progress. I hope to add more functionality using JavaScript and React. :sparkles:
Any advise or suggestions are welcome.
