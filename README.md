# TAX TIDY

## :bulb: About 
This app is a tool to keep help people keep organised and feel confident about tax. I am an ATO tax help volunteer and it was inspired after seeing the angst and confusion some people have around tax. 

I will be continually working on it as I learn more about web development. 

## :clipboard: Phase 1

Initially it tracks tax deductions for each financial year. It has the functionality of CRUD methods for deductions using a PostgreSQL database and AWS S3 storage for uploaded images. Expenses can be viewed individually with the receipt, summarised in a table, bar chart and pie chart. 

## :books: Learning Outcome

This was devloped to practise concepts learnt. Initially it includes Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, AWS3, Bootstrap.
The next phase will be to incorporate JavaScript and React as I become more comfortable with these technologies.

## :clipboard: Installation

This app uses Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL and the following dependancies:
- gem 'bootstrap', '~> 4.5.2'
- gem 'jquery-rails'
- gem 'simple_form'
- gem 'devise'
- gem 'chartkick'

## :construction: Further development

This is a MVP but still work in progress. Stay tuned for more functionality. :sparkles:
Any advise or suggestions are welcome.
